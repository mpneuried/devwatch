devwatch
===========

# Flexible file watcher.

`devwatch` is a super flexible file watcher. You can watch different files for changes and run a bash command.

**Note: This module is only tested on OSX!**

*Written in coffee-script*

# Install

**Note:** You have to install it global

```bash
  npm -g install devwatch
```

## RUN

`devwatch` takes at least 2 arguments. But you can add multiple commands.
On start the module scans the current folder plus subfolders for files matching the given `file-regex`

```
devwatch 'file-regex' 'command 1' 'command 2' â€¦ 'command n'
```

### Arguments:

- `file-regex`: is a regular expression to filter all files under the current folder tree 
- `command` is a bash command with will be called from the current folder.

## Example

```
devwatch '.soy$' 'soy2js {NAME} de_de' 'soy2js {NAME} en_us'
```

In this example `devwatch` searches for files that end with *.soy*.
On start and on a file change 2 commands called `soy2js` with different arguments will be called.

## Replacements

You can define different variables to be replaced by `devwatch`

- `{PATH}`: the path to the watched file *( e.g. /my/special/path )*
- `{FILE}`: the watched file *( e.g. mywatchedfile.js )*
- `{NAME}`: the watched filename *( e.g. mywatchedfile )*
- `{EXT}`: the watched file extension *( e.g. js )*

# Work in progress

`nodecache` is work in progress. Your ideas, suggestions etc. are very welcome.
