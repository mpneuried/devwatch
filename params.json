You can watch different files for changes and run a bash command.\r\n\r\n**Note: This module is only tested on OSX!**\r\n\r\n*Written in coffee-script*\r\n\r\n# Install\r\n\r\n**Note:** You have to install it global\r\n\r\n```bash\r\n  npm -g install devwatch\r\n```\r\n\r\n## RUN\r\n\r\n`devwatch` takes at least 2 arguments. But you can add multiple commands.\r\nOn start the module scans the current folder plus subfolders for files matching the given `file-regex`\r\n\r\n```\r\ndevwatch 'file-regex' 'command 1' 'command 2' â€¦ 'command n'\r\n```\r\n\r\n### Arguments:\r\n\r\n- `file-regex`: is a regular expression to filter all files under the current folder tree \r\n- `command` is a bash command with will be called from the current folder.\r\n\r\n## Example\r\n\r\n```\r\ndevwatch '.soy$' 'soy2js {NAME} de_de' 'soy2js {NAME} en_us'\r\n```\r\n\r\nIn this example `devwatch` searches for files that end with *.soy*.\r\nOn start and on a file change 2 commands called `soy2js` with different arguments will be called.\r\n\r\n## Replacements\r\n\r\nYou can define different variables to be replaced by `devwatch`\r\n\r\n- `{PATH}`: the path to the watched file *( e.g. /my/special/path )*\r\n- `{FILE}`: the watched file *( e.g. mywatchedfile.js )*\r\n- `{NAME}`: the watched filename *( e.g. mywatchedfile )*\r\n- `{EXT}`: the watched file extension *( e.g. js )*\r\n\r\n# Work in progress\r\n\r\n`nodecache` is work in progress.
